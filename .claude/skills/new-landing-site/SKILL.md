# New client landing site

This repo is the template. `la.speedywindshield.com` is the reference build.
The machinery is client-agnostic; the content is not.

## What is reusable and what is not

**Reuse unchanged** — `landing/build-pages.cjs` (generator), `landing/verify.cjs`
(assertions), `qa/tracking-check.cjs`, `qa/render-check.cjs`,
`landing/fetch-reviews.cjs`, `landing/ads-sheet.cjs`.

**Rewrite per client** — `landing/pages.config.cjs` and `landing/cities.config.cjs`
(all page content), the `:root` colour block in `landing/speedy.html`, and
`landing/img/`.

**Re-derive per client, never copy** — the compliance block and the ad copy rules.
See "Compliance" below. Copying California auto-glass compliance to a client in
another state or vertical is a legal problem, not a shortcut.

## Architecture, in one paragraph

`landing/speedy.html` is a valid standalone page AND the master template.
Content is injected between region markers `<!--PAGE:NAME-->…<!--/PAGE:NAME-->`,
and `{{TOKENS}}` are substituted from `site` in `pages.config.cjs`. Asset paths
are written as `/SPEEDY/...` in the template and rewritten at build time, so the
template opens correctly from disk during design work. Images are content-hashed
(md5, 8 chars) and served `immutable, max-age=31536000` — never reuse a filename
and expect a change to appear.

`region()` fills **every** occurrence of a marker, not the first. Two markers
appear twice in the template.

## If the client already has a landing page — do this FIRST

Before writing a single page, inventory the URLs their ads already point at.
A Google Ads final URL that 404s gets the ad disapproved for "Destination not
working", usually within hours of Google's next crawl. The ad group stops
serving, and the landing page history goes with it. This is the failure that
turns a migration into an outage.

**The authoritative list is the Ads account, not the old site.** A final URL can
be referenced by an ad without being linked anywhere crawlable, so a crawl alone
will miss URLs. Export final URLs at **keyword, ad and sitelink level**, then
also pull the old sitemap as a second source.

1. Export final URLs from Google Ads into a text file, one per line. The
   checker tolerates a pasted export — it takes the first URL-looking column.
2. **Name the new pages with the old slugs.** Exact parity, not a redirect.
   Set `slug` in `pages.config.cjs` to whatever the old URL was. If the old
   site used `/free-windshield-quote`, the new page is `/free-windshield-quote`
   — ugly slugs are cheaper than disapproved ads. Rename later, deliberately,
   after updating the final URLs in Ads first.
3. List them in `migration.preserve` so a future edit cannot silently drop one:
   `preserve: ['/free-windshield-quote', '/windshield-replacement']`
4. Check it, before the DNS cutover:
   ```
   npm run build:landing
   npm run check:urls -- --file ads-final-urls.txt
   npm run check:urls -- --sitemap https://oldsite.com/sitemap.xml
   ```
   Reports EXACT / REDIRECT ONLY / WOULD 404 and exits non-zero on anything
   that is not exact.
5. `npm run verify` then enforces it every build: a preserved slug that stops
   building, a redirect pointing at a page that does not exist, a redirect
   whose source is also a real page (so it would never fire), a duplicate
   source, or a loop.

### Redirects are the exception, not the tool

**Do not redirect anything an ad points at.** An off-domain redirect from a
final URL is a policy violation outright (destination mismatch), and even a
same-domain redirect adds a hop the crawler follows before it scores landing
page experience — cost with no benefit.

`migration.redirects` exists for legacy URLs **no ad depends on**: old organic
pages, a Google Business Profile link, a number on a van. Those are emitted as
301 into the root `vercel.json`. `check:urls` treats a redirect as a failure
unless you pass `--allow-redirects`, so use that flag only for a list you have
confirmed contains no ad final URLs.

## Harvest their existing photography before asking for any

Do this at the same time as the URL inventory — both come from the same sources.
A client who says they have no photos usually has a dozen on a site they forgot
about, at better resolution than anything they will shoot on a phone this week.

**Where to look**, in order of yield:
1. Their main website, including `/wp-content/uploads/` — WordPress keeps every
   upload. Fetch the homepage, extract `src`, `data-src`, `srcset` and CSS
   `url(...)`, then walk the service and gallery pages too.
2. The old landing page you are replacing.
3. Their Google Business Profile photos.
4. Only then ask them to shoot something.

**Take:** anything unmistakably theirs — the branded van, their premises, their
signage, work in progress, vehicles they actually serviced. Date-named uploads
(`2023-10-14.webp`) are almost always real job photos. For a mobile service
business the **van shots are the most valuable thing on the site**, because the
whole proposition is that the van comes to you.

**Do not take:**
- **Carrier or brand logos.** The reference client's own site carries GEICO,
  USAA, AAA, Farmers, State Farm and Progressive marks. Those are a trademark
  and affiliation problem and are already banned by the copy rules here. Leave
  them, and mention to the client that they carry the same exposure on the site
  they came from.
- **Manufacturer press renders** — a vehicle on a flat studio background is
  marketing imagery, not their work.
- **Stock and Wikimedia** — the tells are a resolution that beats every other
  file, a model-perfect subject, and no brand context anywhere in frame.
  Obvious stock on a local service page costs more trust than the polish gains,
  because a visitor who recognises it stops believing the reviews too.

Strip EXIF on the way in (`Image.convert('RGB')` drops it), and check for GPS
before publishing anything shot at a private address.

**Captions carry technical detail, not description.** "Retention tape stays on
while the urethane cures" earns more than "our team at work". And if a photo
shows premises in a different city from the one the page sells to, say so in
the caption — see the storefront entry in `pages.config.cjs`.

## The warranty badge is reusable, with one condition

`landing/img/warranty-badge.png` carries no business name, so it works on any
client site. Two rules before reusing it:

1. **Only if that client genuinely offers a lifetime workmanship warranty**, and
   only where the page defines what it covers and excludes directly beside it.
   The badge is honest because it is self-issued and substantiated. On a client
   who does not offer the warranty it is a fabricated credential.
2. **Confirm the licence.** It came from the reference client's site and may be
   purchased or stock artwork their designer licensed for one business. Reusing
   it across a portfolio is a licensing question worth asking before it appears
   on five sites.

Never restyle it, or anything else, to imply third-party accreditation.

## Gallery symmetry is automatic

The gallery grid is six columns with each photo spanning two, and CSS rules
handle an incomplete final row: a lone last photo spans the full width at 21:9,
and a last pair takes half each. Every count from 1 to 8 fills its rows with no
stranded photo beside empty cells. Add as many photos as the client has without
counting them into threes.

**Symmetry is the client's most frequent note.** Any repeating block needs to
divide evenly at every column count it reaches, or fill the last row
deliberately. The same rule already covers the insurance radios (two halves and
a full-width third, all three stacked below 360px) and the stat band. When a
label is the thing breaking a row — one caption wrapping to two lines while its
neighbours fit — shorten the label rather than adjusting the grid.

## What the page carries beyond text

These exist on the reference build and are worth keeping. All of them are
generated, so they cost nothing per client beyond real data.

| Element | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Google mark + score | hero chip, sticky header, map card | `<span>`, never a link in the header — the call button is the only tap target there |
| Star rows | hero, section heads, review cards | pop in on a stagger |
| Stat band | after the three steps | figures **derived**, never authored; counts up on view |
| Step timeline | how-it-works | connector joining the numbered discs, draws in on view |
| Warranty badge | warranty section | self-issued, see above |
| Photo watermarks | gallery | anchored to the image, not the figure |
| Review cards | reviews section | avatar disc, name, relative date, Google mark |

### Motion rules — all three are load-bearing

1. **Additive, never required.** The default state must be the finished state.
   A class the script adds (`.js-anim`) turns the *start* state on, so no JS and
   no `prefers-reduced-motion` both leave the real content on screen. Getting
   this backwards means a decoration failure removes the thing it decorates —
   the step connector shipped that way until it was caught.
2. **Counted numbers keep their final value in the HTML.** `data-count` drives
   the animation; the element's own text is already the formatted result, and
   the script restores that exact string when it finishes. Verify with
   `javaScriptEnabled:false` and `reducedMotion:'reduce'`.
3. **Two observers, not one.** Entry fires early (root bottom shrunk 30%, so the
   block reaches the upper two thirds before it counts); exit fires only when
   the block leaves the viewport completely. Without that hysteresis the
   animation retriggers while the section is half on screen. A single
   `threshold` also fires off the bottom edge on tall blocks — the animation
   plays where nobody can see it.

## Build order for a new client

1. **Copy the repo.** New GitHub repo, new Vercel project.
2. **Inventory existing URLs and harvest their photography** if this is a
   migration — the two sections above. Both read the same sources, so do them
   in one pass.
3. **Fill `site` in `pages.config.cjs`.** Every field in the checklist below.
4. **Palette.** Replace the `:root` variables. Compute contrast — do not
   estimate it. Body text needs 4.5:1, large text 3:1, and any colour carrying a
   border or an icon needs 3:1. The reference build's cyan failed at 2.62:1 and
   could not be used for text; the orange had to darken to `#CB4E1A` to reach
   4.52:1.
5. **Content.** Home, service pages, county/region hubs, city pages.
6. **Reviews.** Put the client's Google Place ID in `fetch-reviews.cjs`, set the
   `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` secret, run `npm run check:placeid` to confirm it
   resolves to the right business before trusting it.
7. **Verify, then deploy.** See the gates below.

## Per-client checklist

Every one of these is wrong until changed. A site that ships with the reference
client's phone number sends leads to the wrong business.

| Where | Field |
|---|---|
| `site` | `domain`, `legalName`, `brandShort`, `email` |
| `site` | `phoneFormatted` / `phoneE164` — the DNI-swapped number |
| `site` | `barPhoneFormatted` / `barPhoneE164`, `barArd` — registered number, or blank |
| `site` | `callAsset` — the Google call-forwarding number, excluded from DNI |
| `site` | `address`, `geo.lat` / `geo.lng` (verify these, they are easy to leave approximate) |
| `site.ads` | `conversionId` (`AW-…`), `conversionLabel`, `leadValue` |
| `site.ghl` | `webhook`, `locationId`, `poolId` |
| `fetch-reviews.cjs` | Place ID and the `EXPECT_*` guards |
| `landing/img/` | logo, OG image, favicons, photography |
| `ads-sheet.cjs` | the `GROUPS` data block |
| `pages.config.cjs` | `trust` (hero strip), `gallery` (photos), `migration` |
| `landing/img/` | `warranty-badge.png` only if that client offers the warranty |

## Form

The form is currently auto-glass shaped: vehicle, VIN, insurance, carrier,
service. For another glass client it is already correct. For a different
vertical the field list, labels, validation rules and options need to become
config-driven first — do that work in the template, do not fork it.

Required fields must live **outside** the collapsible drawer. A required field
inside a collapsed section means the visitor presses submit and the error lands
on something they cannot see. `verify.cjs` asserts this.

## Tracking

Report form conversions **from the page**, calls from GHL. Never both — GHL's
Ads integration is offline-import only and does not fire on Inbound Webhook,
which is exactly why the split exists. If "Add to Google Ads" is left on inside
the GHL form workflow, every lead counts twice.

The conversion fires only after the webhook confirms delivery, and dedupes on a
`transaction_id` built from the click ID plus the last 10 digits of the phone.
Retesting from the same browser with the same phone will fire nothing.

Attribution captures 8 click IDs and 5 UTMs into `sessionStorage`. Absent
parameters are sent as empty strings so the key set stays stable — GHL builds
its mapping picker from the captured sample request, so **send one sample with
every key populated** before mapping fields, or the click IDs never appear in
the dropdown. See `docs/ghl-field-mapping.md`.

## Compliance

Re-derive from primary sources for the client's state and vertical. For the
reference build these were: California Penal Code § 551(b) (insurance
inducements — blocks deductible-offset language), 16 CCR § 3371.2 (registered
firm name, registration number and registered telephone in internet
advertising, and DNI may be treated as misleading), California Insurance Code
§ 758.5 (the insurer cannot require its own shop).

The rules encoded in `ads-sheet.cjs` — no deductible offset, no carrier
affiliation claims, no unqualified drive-away time, no invented prices, no
superlatives — are insurance/auto-glass specific. Replace them; do not inherit
them silently.

## CSS traps that produced real bugs here

Four defects on the reference build came from two root causes. Both will recur.

### 1. Source order decides, because media queries add no specificity

`a.card{display:block}` written after `@media(max-width:719px){ a.card{display:grid} }`
silently wins at every width. This bit four times: a leftover `.seal` size from
a superseded version, the card grid, `.nav + .hdr-cta{margin-left:0}` sitting
outside a media query so it cancelled an auto-margin on mobile, and a `.seal`
rule from the SVG era overriding the PNG sizes.

**Read the computed style in the browser, not the stylesheet.** Every one of
these looked right in the source. `getComputedStyle(el).display` is the only
thing that settles it.

### 2. A dark band is not always `.sec-dark`

`.final` is its own navy gradient and matches no `.sec-dark` selector. That
produced an eyebrow at **1.33:1** — invisible, not merely low — and later a call
button that stayed solid orange beside the solid orange submit so neither read
as primary. Dark-background rules now use `:is(.sec-dark,.final)`. Any new rule
written for a dark background needs both.

Note the render check cannot catch the contrast half: it reads computed CSS, and
that text sits on a gradient, so there is no single background colour to compare
against. Contrast on gradients has to be measured from rendered pixels or worked
out from the gradient stops by hand.

### 3. "Empty space" is a property of the layout, not the element

Anything absolutely positioned into a gap needs checking at every column count.
The step watermark icons were placed in an empty top-right corner that only
exists in the three-column layout; at one column that corner is the middle of a
paragraph. Moving them to the gutter then collided with the timeline, and the
480–899px band clipped them in half because their position depended on the
paragraph's height. They were eventually deleted — two faint decorations
competing in one box is worse than one clear one.

### 4. Tap targets need size AND separation

Absorbing a list's row gap into the link box hits 44px and leaves adjacent
targets touching at **0px**, which is a coin flip for a thumb on the boundary.
Keep the 44px box and give the gap back: `li{margin:0 0 8px}` with
`a{padding:8px 0;min-height:44px}`.

### 5. The legal pages carry their own stylesheet

`legal-privacy.html` and `legal-terms.html` are standalone and do not inherit
`speedy.html`'s media queries. Identical footer markup measured 34.8px there
against 44px on the main pages, and the reading measure was uncapped at 115
characters per line. They are hand-synced today — **factor this into a shared
partial rather than patching it twice again.**

### 6. `ch` is not a character

`.prose{max-width:72ch}` rendered **96 characters per line**. The `ch` unit is
the advance width of "0", far wider than average lowercase. 56ch lands at ~75,
which is the top of the comfortable range. Measure per line with
`Range.getBoundingClientRect()` rather than dividing by font size.

## Do not invent facts about the business

The compliance rules in this repo ban carrier logos, certifications and prices.
The same rule covers anything a visitor could rely on, and it is easy to breach
without noticing when research *feels* like evidence.

Four city pages here shipped claiming bilingual staffing — "Spanish-speaking
staff answering the phone and on the vans", "ask for one and you will get one",
a heading reading "We speak Armenian" in Armenian, and two Spanish-language FAQs
answering "Sí. Tenemos personal que habla español." The demographics behind them
were correct and verified. **The staffing was an assumption**, and the client's
own site made no bilingual claim anywhere.

Worse than a wrong claim: those FAQs sat in the FAQPage JSON-LD, so they could
surface in Google results and bring a Spanish- or Armenian-only caller to a line
that could not serve them. A wasted paid click and a bad experience.

The test is not "is this plausible for a business like this" but "did the client
tell me this". Demographics justify *targeting* a language; only the client
justifies *claiming* one.

## Verification gates

All four must pass before deploy. They exist because each caught a real defect.

```
npm run build:landing
npm run verify        # preflight + 15 sections, must be 0 failures 0 warnings
npm run qa:tracking   # 18 assertions in a real browser
npm run qa:render     # overflow AND clipped overflow, console errors, tap targets
npm run build:adsheet # refuses to write if any asset breaks Google's limits
npm run check:urls -- --file old-urls.txt   # migrations only, before cutover
```

`npm run verify` runs `preflight.cjs` first, which refuses to build while any
client value is still a placeholder or still belongs to the previous client —
a copied repo that keeps the old GHL webhook sends the new client's leads to
someone else's CRM, and nothing about the page looks wrong when it happens.

`qa:render` flags two kinds of overflow. Content past the viewport while the
document does **not** scroll is the more dangerous one — a parent is clipping it,
so it is invisible rather than reachable, and the old scrollWidth-only test
stayed silent while a card heading wrapped one word per line off the screen.

When changing the template on an existing site, snapshot `quote-site/` first and
diff after rebuilding. An empty diff proves a refactor changed nothing.

**Editing the generator: never slice by index.** Finding a function's end with
`indexOf` overshot here and deleted 177 lines including seven functions and both
Google mark constants. Use exact string replacement and check `git diff --stat`
before building.

## Deployment

**Vercel production deploys from `main`.** Pushing to a feature branch produces
a preview deployment on a `*.vercel.app` URL and does **not** update the client's
domain. This has silently swallowed several rounds of fixes — if the client says
"it still isn't there", check `git log origin/main` before re-debugging the code.

Root `vercel.json` sets `outputDirectory: "quote-site"`.

## Things that look like bugs and are not

- **No conversion in Google Ads after a test submit.** Google only records
  conversions it can attribute to an ad click. A direct visit has no `gclid`, so
  the tag fires and Google discards it. Reporting also lags ~3h, and conversions
  are dated to the click, not the submit.
- **"Add the Google tag / event snippet" in the Ads UI.** A status message that
  persists until the action records attributable activity. Not a diagnosis.
- **Only 2–5 review quotes.** The Places API returns at most 5 reviews. That is
  the ceiling, not a filter bug.
- **A lead arriving with blank `service` or `insurance`.** Impossible from this
  form — both always carry a value, defaults included. It came from somewhere
  else, usually a GHL workflow whose trigger is broader than the Inbound Webhook,
  or a direct POST to the webhook URL (which is public in page source and cannot
  be defended from the page).
